Customer Sentiment Analysis is a web application built with Streamlit that allows users to input customer reviews and classify the sentiment as Positive, Neutral, or Negative. The application uses a pre-trained machine learning model for predictions.

 Features

- User-Friendly Interface**: Allows users to enter reviews through a simple text box.
- pSentiment Analysis: Classifies reviews into three categories: Positive, Neutral, or Negative.
- Preprocessing: Automatically preprocesses the input text for accurate predictions.
-Real-Time Prediction: Provides instant feedback to the user.
